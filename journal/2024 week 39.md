# Heat transfer through the cell

Having succefully liqufied CO<sub>2</sub> in the climate chamber last week we now valuate how this cell could be used when CO<sub>2</sub> is liquified with Peltier modules, which provide much less cooling power.

Parameters of the cell:
* $`A_{ext} = 77e^{-4} \, m^2`$ - external surface
* $`A_{int} = 20.8e^{-4} \, m^2`$ - internal surface
* $`L = 1e^{-2} \, m`$ - thikness of the wall
* $`V = 6.87 \, ml`$ - internal volume

## Heat transfer by conduction

The thermal conductivity of Polyetheretherketone (PEEK) is about $`k = 0.3 \, W/mK`$ (see [here](https://thermtest.com/application/thermal-conductivity-of-peek), [here](https://www.hpp-performance.com/fileadmin/user_upload/user_upload/fluteck_K_300-FLS_v15.03_datenblatt_PEEK.pdf) and [here](https://www.directplastics.co.uk/pdf/datasheets/PEEK%20Data%20Sheet.pdf)). Thus, the thermal conductance of the cell (assume the internal volume is covered with a lid made of PEEK with the same thikness as the cell's body, i.e. 1 cm): 
* At the external surface: $`C_{ext} = k\times A_{ext}/L = 0.3 \times 77e^{-4}/1e^{-2} = 0.231 \, W/K`$;
* At the internal surface: $`C_{int} = k\times A_{int}/L = 0.3 \times 20.8e^{-4}/1e^{-2} = 0.0924 \, W/K`$;
* Total (simplified): $`C = 1/(1/0.0924 + 1/0.231) = 0.1848\, W/K`$.

### CO<sub>2</sub> at &minus;45&deg;C
With the liquid CO<sub>2</sub> at the temperature -45&deg;C in the cell, and the external room temperature 25&deg;C (&#916;T = 70&deg;C) the heat flow through the cell's body:

$`Q = C \times \Delta T = 0.1848 \times 70 = 12.936\, W`$.

### CO<sub>2</sub> at &minus;40&deg;C

$`Q = C \times \Delta T = 0.1848 \times 65 = 12.012\, W`$.

## Heat transfer by radiation

### CO<sub>2</sub> at &minus;45&deg;C
If the cell put in a vacuum the heat would radiate from cell's surface. For the sake of simplicity assume the surface temperature equal to the internal, i.e. -45&deg;C. The amount of the radiated heat:

$`Q = \sigma \times e \times A_{ext} \times (T_1^4 - T_2^4)`$, where:
* $`\sigma = 5.67e^{-8} \, W/(m^2 K^4)`$ - Stefan-Boltzmann constant;
* $`e = 0.95`$ - emissivity of PEEK ([the source](https://repositories.lib.utexas.edu/server/api/core/bitstreams/4e1e9d12-d3e4-4226-afe1-46baf0e80249/content));
* $`A_{ext} = 77e^{-4} \, m^2`$ - radiating surface;
* $`T_1 = (273 + 25) = 298 \, K`$ - ambient temperature;
* $`T_2 = (273 - 45) = 228\, K`$ - cell temperature.

$`Q = 5.67e^{-8} \times 0.95 \times 77e^{-4} \times (298^4 - 228^4) = 2.15 \, W`$.

If the cell would be wraped with an aluminium foil (k = 0.04, see the [source](https://www.engineeringtoolbox.com/emissivity-coefficients-d_447.html)), then the amount of radiated heat would be:

$`Q = 5.67e^{-8} \times 0.04 \times 77e^{-4} \times (298^4 - 228^4) = 0.0905 \, W`$.

### CO<sub>2</sub> at &minus;40&deg;C
Without aluminium foil:

$`Q = 5.67e^{-8} \times 0.95 \times 77e^{-4} \times (298^4 - 233^4) = 2.05 \, W`$.

With aluminium foil:

$`Q = 5.67e^{-8} \times 0.04 \times 77e^{-4} \times (298^4 - 233^4) = 0.0863 \, W`$.

### Observations:
* The rough aluminium has emmisivity 0.07, which is close to the value 0.04 of the aluminium foil. That's why we observed no improvement of thermal performance in the experiment in the [week 24](</journal/2024 week 24.md>).
* The surface area is linearly proportional to amount of conducted and radiated heat. We need to keep the cell's size as small as possible.

## Heat transfer by conduction and radiation
If the cell is put in vacuum we may need to calculate the amount of resulting heat transfer and the temperature of the cell's external surface. The same amount of heat is transfered by the both conduction and radiation:

$`Q_{conduction} = Q_{radiation}`$;  
$`Q_{conduction} = (k \times A / L) \times (T_{surface} - T_{internal})`$,  
$`Q_{radiation} = \sigma \times e \times A \times (T_{ambient}^4 - T_{surface}^4)`$. 

i.e.:  
$`(k \times A / L) \times (T_{surface} - T_{internal}) = \sigma \times e \times A \times (T_{ambient}^4 - T_{surface}^4)`$. 

The $`T_{surface}`$ is unknown. Let's find it for the above example of the cell made of PEEK (we use the external surface parameters only) put in vacuum:

### CO<sub>2</sub> at &minus;45&deg;C
$`(0.3 \times 77e^{-4} / 1e^{-2}) \times (T_{surface} - 228) - 5.67e^{-8} \times 0.95 \times 77e^{-4} \times (298^4 - T_{surface}^4) = 0`$;  
$`4.1476e^{-10} \times T_{surface}^4 + 0.231 \times T_{surface} - 55.939 = 0`$;

The above equation, [when solved](https://planetcalc.ru/7715/), gives us the results:

$`T_{surface} = 236.54\degree K = -36.46\, \degree C`$;  
$`Q_{conduction} = Q_{radiation} = 1.97\, W`$.

```js
// Check equality
(0.3 * 77e-4 / 1e-2) * (236.54 - (273 -45)) // = 1.97 Q conduction
(5.67e-8 * 0.95 * 77e-4) * (Math.pow(273 + 25, 4) - Math.pow(236.54, 4)) // = 1.97 Q radiation
```

### CO<sub>2</sub> at &minus;40&deg;C

$`4.1476e^{-10} \times T_{surface}^4 + 0.231 \times T_{surface} - 57.094 = 0`$;  
$`T_{surface} = 241.09\degree K = -31.91 \degree C`$;  
$`Q_{conduction} = Q_{radiation} = 1.87\, W`$.

```js
// Check equality
(0.3 * 77e-4 / 1e-2) * (241.09 - (273 - 40)) // = 1.87 Q conduction
(5.67e-8 * 0.95 * 77e-4) * (Math.pow(273 + 25, 4) - Math.pow(241.09, 4)) // = 1.87 Q radiation
```
