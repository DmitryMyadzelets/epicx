# The CO2 condenser (continued)
This week was dedicated to the design of a structure to convey the experiments at IMM. One of the requirements was usage of available materials and tools.

The past experiments have shown that the electrochemical cell made at DIFA/UNIBO is suitable to be used at target conditions: pressue 1M Pa, temperature -45 &deg;C. We now continue to design the CO2 condenser to be used in the vacuum chamber at IMM.

The rationaly and initial design of the CO2 condenser is described [earlier](</journal/2024 week 40.md>). For convenience, it's shown below.

It's [advised](https://www.uweelectronic.de/en/temperaturmanagement-2/peltierelemente.html) to provide the contact pressure on the Peltier modules of 0.3-0.8 MPa. The pressure should be even. In the current design we use a clamp, with screws for the pressure adjustment, as shown below.

To provide the given pressue we have to apply a force:

$`F = P \times A`$, where:
* $`P = 0.5 MPa = 0.5 \times 10^6 N/m^2`$;
* $` A = 4 \times 4 = 16 cm^2 = 0.0016 m^2`$ - the surface of the Peiltier modules.

$`F = 0.5 \times 10^6 \times 0.0016 = 800 N`$.

For the given force we need to apply a torque on the screw:

$`\tau = (F \times L) / (2 \times \pi \times \eta)`$, where:
* $`L`$ - screw lead;
* $`\eta = 0.2`$ - efficiency of the screw (depends on lubrification, etc).

The calculated torque for some screws:

| Screw | Lead, mm | $`\tau`$, Nm | 
| --: | --: | --: |
| M4 | 0.4 | 0.45 |
| M6 | 1.0 | 0.64 |
| M8 | 1.25 | 0.8 |

The thermal paste used to increase the heat exchange between the parts of the assemply favors to lower its mechanical rigidity. To prevent it the 3D-printed holders are used, as shown below:

The assembled condenser is then mounted to the (new) aluminium cap of the vacuum camera:

The cap has inlets and outlets for the CO2, water and electrical connections.

Note: the thermal expansion of the assembly may loosen the contact pressure on the Peltier modules. We may need to compensate it with e.g. a spring.
