# Machining the condenser camera and a flange

This week we have started machining parts of the CO2 condenser and of the vacuum chamber. The vacuum chamber requires a new bottom flange with the all required connectors.

## The condenser camera
The dimensions of the condenser camera are defined by the size of the Peltier modules and the diamter of the fittings. It's made of aluminium. On the sides it has a few M3 holes for a supporting structure, and a 1 mm hole for a thermocouple.

Below is the camera machined according to the design.

## The vacuum chamber flange
Of-the-shelf flanges are usually made of stainless steel. We have one such for the top comver of the vacuum chamber; it should be used with no any modification. The bottom flange has to have a banch of connectors and fittings. We make it of an available aluminium plate, as a copy of the off-the-shelf flange, according to the following design.

It has been found the the available machining possibilities are limited. The exact copy of the existent flange couldn't be made. Though it is sufficent for our purposes. At the first step only the outlet for the vacuum pump was put, to test if the chamber can hold negative pressure.
