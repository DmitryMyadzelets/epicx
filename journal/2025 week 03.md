# Testing the condenser camera and the flange
## Tightness test of the camera
To carry out the tightness test of the assembled condenser camera with the fittings we put it under pressure (the available gas equimpent provides pressure up to 8 Bar) and observe if there is any gas loss in water. 

The first test showed signicafant loss of gas due to partial damage of the gas tube. The damage happens when a plastic tube extracted from a metal fitting. The most practical solution of this problem seems to cut out the damaged end of the tube (it should be rule of thumb). When it was done, the following test showed no gas loss; see the photo below.

## Force test
According to the design the CO2 condenser consist of a stack of Peltier modules, water cooling blocks and the condenser camera. To provide a thermal exchange this stack has to be squeezed, as suggested by manufactures of Peltier modueles, with about 500 N force.

To measure the forse a tool consisting of a pressure sensor, a dedicated analog-to-digital converter (HX711) and a microcontroller was built. The measurement tool was (roughly) calibrated in 2 points: 0 and 18 kg weight.

The 500 N force was applied using a vise, as shown on the photo below.

In the following, to create the requred force, a compression spring will be used. It would account thermal expansion of hhe stack in the range of working temperatures (70 &deg;C).

## Tightness test of the flange
The new vacuum chamber was assembled to test if it can hold vacuum. The vacuum pump could reach minimal absolute pressue 0.22 mBar. The next day the absolute pressure remaind in the chamber was 2.3 mBar.

Though some geometrical parameters of the new flange can and should be improved, it have passed the tightness test.
