# Condenser holder prototype @ NEMA 2000 connectors

## Condenser holder prototype 
We've started 3D-printing part of the condenser holder, at a facility of CNR. The initial design of the holder is shown at the image below.

First virsions of some parts have shown that they are too rigid, and there must be added some flexibility due to vairable dimentions of the assembly. Tuning of the 3D-printing process also took place.

Current design of these holder parts assumes they not only facilitate the assembling but can also be removed when all the part of the condenser are fixed in place.

The question if the plastic parts of the holder whould be neccessary in the condenser when all the parts are tightne is open. It whould be better if they could be removed, as they may favor some heat loss.

## NEMA 2000 connectors
The NEMA 2000 electrical connects are choosen for the vacuum camera. They have IP67 protection rating and variable number of the contact pins. Not mentioning their affordability.
