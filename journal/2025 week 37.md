# Week 37 - Working space and Lab

This week was dedicated to the setup of a working space in the room 410. The laboratory setup of the project has moved to the ground floor. To be done before the lab can be operational:

- Get electricity connected, with populated outlets
- Find a new oiless vacuum pump
- Get the CO<sub>2</sub> tank back
- Get the 2nd stage water or water cooling system  

I revised how a potentistat work with different number of electrodes and why one would use any of these (the internal schematics with oprational amplifiers is self expenatory). Came to a conclustion we don't need to use a refference elecdrode. However, Raffa has convinced me we have to.

For an article we have to recalculate more presisly how much volume the setup at DIFA was used for the CO<sub>2</sub> conversion. We reassembled the setup and filled it with water. The measuments showed that it contains 17.7 ml. Then, we measured geometric properties of the involed volumes (tubies, cell, etc), and calculated the total geometric volume of the system: 16.08 ml. See the paper notes for the details.

See the paper notes for the foradic efficiency calculation.
