+ Cleaning the lab 144.
+ Moving to the lab: vacuum camera, water tank, water chiller.

+ The dry vacuum pump found in the lab 430 doesn't work. I disassembled it and found the membrany became too rigid, the motor stucks.
+ Estimation of an air cooling solution in order to replace the water chiller. At the first stage, for the gas liquification, one Peltier module works at 12V 2.1A, i.e consumes about 25 W (the cooling power is relatively low, about 3 W, so we can ignore it). Assume we want, as with the chiller, the temperture of the water at about 5 degrees. Let the temperature of the hot side, where a radiator with a vent shuld be attached, be 50 degrees. The delta T is then 45 degrees, and the cooling power, according to the specs for the ET-190-1010-1212 Peltier module, is about 8 W. We would need at least 3 Peltier modules to pump 25 W out through the cold side. The whaste heat from the hot side is 35 W for each module, 105 W for 3 modules. Modern CPU air coolers can dissipate 50..200 W. Hence, we need at least one of an efficent one. Currently we user 2 Peltier modules for the gas cooling. Hence we need double the results, i.e. get a air cooling solution which can handle at least 110 W.
