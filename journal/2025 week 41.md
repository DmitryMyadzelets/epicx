The current 1-stage setup with the chiller, when modeled, has the following parameters (the inputs for the model are in bold):

| Stage | Qc, W | Tc, &deg;C | Th, &deg;C | &#916;T, &deg;C | Modules | I, A | P, W |
| --: | --: | --: | --: | --: | --: | --: | --: |
| 1 | 4.01 | **-43** | **10.81** | 53.81 | **1** | **2.1** | 22.49 |

Qc/module, W: 4.01
P total, W: 22.49

From the above we can estimate that Qc is about 4 Watt per module, 8 Watt total. With all the heat losses including glass, electrodes, etc.

With 2-stages cooling we can get the same Qc and -60, but with direct interstage connection only (due to low interstage temperature)

| Stage | Qc, W | Tc, &deg;C | Th, &deg;C | &#916;T, &deg;C | Modules | I, A | P, W |
| --: | --: | --: | --: | --: | --: | --: | --: |
| 1 | 4.3 | -60 | -20.35 | 39.65 | 1 | 2.1 | 18.23 |
| 2 | 22.52 | -20.35 | 33 | 53.35 | 4 | 2.1 | 100.67 |

Qc/module, W: 0.86
P total, W: 118.9

To get -43 it's enough to use 3 modules at the 2-nd stage:

| Stage | Qc, W | Tc, &deg;C | Th, &deg;C | &#916;T, &deg;C | Modules | I, A | P, W |
| --: | --: | --: | --: | --: | --: | --: | --: |
| 1 | 5.46 | -43 | -3.22 | 39.78 | 1 | 2.1 | 20.31 |
| 2 | 25.78 | -3.22 | 33.01 | 36.23 | 3 | 2.1 | 73.77 |

Qc/module, W: 1.37
P total, W: 94.08

In the above calculation we can surely have higher Tc at the 2-stage, which is necessary for water cooling. In other words, 4 modules at the 2-nd stage is overkill if no direct interstage connection is used. The 4 modules would be better but for direct interstage connection, which requires us to design new vacuum system.

## todo
    - Check the temperature rise at the hot side of the Peltier when the Cu heat exchanger is used. Compare it with th eresults described in the week 26, 2024.
    - Make spare glass windows for the cell
    - Experiment with the reference eletcrode at DIFA
    - Make more precise calculations for air cooling
    - Check for TMP119 precise temperature i2c sensor made by TI
