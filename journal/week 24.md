## Week 24 - 
The mathematical models we created previously can be used to represent the discrete chart from the the specification for PE-16 as a continious chart, for better understanding:

<img alt="3D chart - Qc wrt T diff and T hot" src="/img/2024-06-10 - 3D chart - Qc wrt T diff and T hot.png" width=400px>

Similary, where &#916;T is replaces with T cold:

<img alt="3D chart - Qc wrt T cold and T hot" src="/img/2024-06-10 - 3D chart - Qc wrt T cold and T hot.png" width=400px>
