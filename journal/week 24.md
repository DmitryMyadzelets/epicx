## Week 24 - 
The mathematical models we created previously can be used to represent the discrete chart from the the specification for PE-16 as a continious chart, for better understanding:

Similary, where &#916;T is replaces with T cold:

<img alt="3D chart - Qc wrt T cold and T hot" src="/img/2024-06-10 - 3D chart - Qc wrt T cold and T hot.png" width=400px>

The above chart also shows the extremums for some of our experiments:

| min Qc, W | max T hot &deg;C | min T cold &deg;C | Note |
| --: | --: | --: | --- |
| 2.14 | 33.2 | -40.0 | Vacuum, water colling, nylon fasteners | 
| 3.15 | 34.5 | -33.4 | Air, water colling, nylon fasteners | 
| 3.71 | 33.4 | -30.9 | Air, CPU cooling, insulation, metal fasteners | 

The same chart zoomed in to the experimental data:
