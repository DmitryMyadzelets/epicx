## Week 25 - Pelter in the Climate camera

### Experiment - Cooling PE-16 with cold water
This experiment is an intermidiate step before the experiement in the climate camera. We exploit the existing setup for water cooling.

We used water for domestic usage and a 800W chiller to cool it down. The temperature of the warm water was measured with a mercury thermometer. The temprerature of the cooled water was measured by the chiller.

**Note** We can't calculate the performance of the cooling sistem due to the lack of mesurement data, though we can state that its performance was sufficient to achieve stable thermal conditions of the PE-16.
