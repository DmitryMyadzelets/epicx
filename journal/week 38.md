# Liquid CO2 in the climate chamber

## Experiment - Liquification of CO2
This is our first attempt to liquify CO2. The schematic of the experimental setup is depicted below.

The tank with CO2 at about 40 Bar is connected to the pressure regulator which was set to reduce the pressure down to 10 Bar (i.e. ~1 MPa). The CO2 in gaseous state is then delivered to the cell via the tube. The cell and tube were preliminary emptied from the air with the vacuum pump. The climate chamber was gradually set down to -45&deg;C until the liquification of CO2 was observed via the window of the chamber.

In order to measure the temperature in the cell, a K-type thermocouple was put into the cell. However, we detected a leakage of the gas, and then attached the thermocouple to the gas inlet at the top of the camera, as it has presumably the closest temperature to the temperature of the gas. Additionally, we measured the temperature of the air inside the chamber.

At the end of the experiment, the CO2 in the cell would be heated up to the ambient temperature, thus passing from liquid to gaseous phase at some point. In order to avoid overpressure in the system, a security gas valve set to 10 Bar was added.

The photo below shows the amount of the liquified CO2 (~3 ml) condenced in the cell during the experiment.
