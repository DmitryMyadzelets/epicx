# Liquid CO2 in the climate chamber

## Experiment - Liquification of CO2
This is our first attempt to liquify CO2. The schematic of the experimental setup is depicted below.

The tank with CO2 at about 40 Bar is connected to the pressure regulator which was set to reduce the pressure down to 10 Bar (i.e. ~1 MPa). The CO2 in gaseous state is then delivered to the cell via the tube. The cell and tube were preliminary emptied from the air with the vacuum pump. The climate chamber was gradually set down to -45&deg;C until the liquification of CO2 was observed via the window of the chamber.

In order to measure the temperature in the cell, a K-type thermocouple was put into the cell. However, we detected a leakage of the gas, and then attached the thermocouple to the gas inlet at the top of the camera, as it has presumably the closest temperature to the temperature of the gas. Additionally, we measured the temperature of the air inside the chamber.

At the end of the experiment, the CO2 in the cell would be heated up to the ambient temperature, thus passing from liquid to gaseous phase at some point. In order to avoid overpressure in the system, a security gas valve set to 10 Bar was added.

The photo below shows the amount of the liquified CO2 (~3 ml) condenced in the cell during the experiment.

The following image depicts the temperatures dynamics. See the log list below for details (time is in form hours:minutes from the beginning of the experiment).

* 00:00 - The initial temperature is 33&deg;C, the target temperature of the climate chamber is set to 0&deg;. The cell is vacuumed and has no CO2.
* 00:05 - The cell is filled with CO2 till the pressure reached 10 Bar. New setpoint is -20&deg;. 
* 00:23 - The temperature of the camera is stabilized. The pressure of gas observed at the manometer an the security valve decreased from 10 to 9.2 Bar.
* 00:30 - The cell is refilled up to 10 Bar. New setpoint is -30&deg; (we set it wrongly to +30&deg; for short time).
* 00:53 - The pressure gradually but fast went down to 0 Bar.
* 00:58 - We observe some liquid CO2 in the cell.
* 01:30 - The cell seems to be in equilibrium conditions at 7.6 Bar and 38&deg;C.
* 01:25 - We start to heat up the chamber. New setpoint is -30&deg;c.
* 01:33 - The pressure slowly goes up, and reached 9.8 Bar.
* 01:50 - The liquid CO2 is evaporated. The pressure is 10 Bar.

At the end of the experiment we found that the glass window of the cell has a crack while the remaing pressure in the cell was ~4 Bar. 

A possible reason for the damage could be high strain in the glass due to different thermal expantion of the materials, i.e. of the glass window tighly put into the frame made of PEEK.

The coefficients of thermal expansion (CTE):
* Quartz: 0.5
* PEEK: 26...43

The PEEK frame changed its size for about 0.2 mm in the temperature range going from 33&deg; to -45&deg;C, while the quarz glass - for about 0.002 mm.

Another reason for the damage could be high difference of the temperatures in the cell and in the air during heating it up, to which the glass window was exposed. The evaporating CO2 maintained low temperature inside the cell for long time untill is fully evaporated, while the air in the chamber went from -45&deg; up to positive values.

## Experiment - Liquification with probes
The goal of this experiment was to validate that the existing cell and probes could withstand the pressure of 10 Bar during the liquification. The experiment was conducted as the previous one, though without measurement of the temperatures.

To avoid high temperature difference between the intermal and external areas of the cell the proccess of heating up was modified. The pressure in the cell was lowered from 10 Bar down to 0 Bar with the regulator of the security valve, while the temperature in the chamber remained low. At certain point the liquified CO2 evaporated, and then the system was heated up quickly with no risk of damage due to different CTE.
