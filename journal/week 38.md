# Liquid CO2 in the climate chamber

## Experiment - Liquification of CO2
This is the first our attempt to liquify CO2. The schematic of the experimental setup is depicted below.

The tank with CO2 at about 40 bar is connected to the reductor which was set to reduce the pressure down to 10 bar (i.e. ~1 MPa). The CO2 in gaseous state is then delivered to the cell via the tube. The cell and tube were prelimanary emptied from the air with the vacuum pump. The climate chamber was gradually set down to -45&deg;C untill the liquification of CO2 was observed via the window of the chamber.

In order to measure and record the temperature in the cell a K-type termocouple was put into the cell. However, we detected a leakage of the gas, and then attached the termocouple to the gas inlet at the top of the camera, as it has the temperature presumably closest to the temperature of the gas.
