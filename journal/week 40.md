# The CO2 condencer 

## Why we need a condencer
[The early designs](</journal/week 28.md>) of the CO2 cell assumed that the CO2 liqufication and electrolysis would occure in the same volume of the cell. The internal surface of the cell has to satisfy to at least two criteria:
* High thermal conductivity;
* High resistance to chemicals, and compatibility with electrolytes.

These criteria contradict each other as seems there is no material which satisfy both of them.

Aluminium is considered for the cell as it has high thermal conductivity (240 W/mK), it's cheap and easy for machining. However, electrolisys favors aluminium corrosion, and it may influence the electrolysis outcome.

Polyetherether Ketone (PEEK) is compatible with almost any of the solvents, but it has low thermal conductivity (0.3 W/mK). It's currently usedfor the cell to liquify CO2 in the climate chamber (see [the experiment](</journal/week 38.md>)).
