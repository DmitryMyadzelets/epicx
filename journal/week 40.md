# The CO2 condenser 

## Why we need a condenser
[The early designs](</journal/week 28.md>) of the CO2 cell assumed that the CO2 condensation and electrolysis would occur in the same volume of the cell. The internal surface of the cell has to satisfy to at least two criteria:
* High thermal conductivity;
* High resistance to chemicals, and compatibility with electrolytes.

These criteria contradict each other as it seems we have no one material which would satisfy the both.

Aluminium is considered for the cell as it has high thermal conductivity (240 W/mK), it's cheap and easy for machining. However, electrolisys favors aluminium corrosion, and it may influence an outcome of the process.

Polyetherether Ketone (PEEK) is compatible with almost any of the solvents, but it has low thermal conductivity (0.3 W/mK). Though we currently use it for the cell to liquify CO2 in the climate chamber (see [the experiment](</journal/week 38.md>)).

To solve the above contradiction we can separate the processes of condensation and electrolisys, and conduct them in dedicated volumes. This way we can use the same cell made of PEEK as earlier, for electrolysis. Then we need a condenser for liquification of CO2.
