# The Cu electrode for the cell
In order to conduct new experiments in the electrolytic cell it's requred to have a copper electrode, as proposed by Raffello. There is currently no any "off-the-shelf" electrode available, so we would make an our own.

A few approaches are considered:
* A plain 6 mm copper rod, with no outer
* A 1-3mm copper rod glued into a 6 mm glass tube
* A 1-3mm copper rod glued into a plastic holder

The version of the electrode made of a glass tube and a copper rode glued into it may be problematic due to different coefficients of thermal expansion of the materials. Particularly, the [LOCTITE EA 9497 adhesive](https://datasheets.tdx.henkel.com/LOCTITE-EA-9497-en_GL.pdf) has 50×10-6 as such, while a quatz glass has it 0.55x10-6. The borosilicate glass (e.g. used for [some glass tubes](https://it.aliexpress.com/item/32899234262.htm)) has 3×10-6 as such.

An example of an "off-the-shelf" electrode with the holder in the cell is depicted below:

## The electrode holder

The plastic holder currently used at DIFA/UNIBO is shown below. It's designed to hold 6mm electrodes, with help of an o-ring and an additional threaded part (not shown).

We've designed a new plastic holder, with a 6mm hole, for 3-D printing.

Note: Google SketchUp software is used as a CAD tool. Watch [the tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k8AC5LNMo-g) for a screw thread design, with [ISO metric parameters](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_metric_screw_thread) for a M10x1.5 screw. This software, however, have some limitations, e.g. we have to design the part scaled up 10 times, and then scale it down, to overcome some of them. 

The tools and materials used for 3D printing:
* [PreForm print preparation software](https://formlabs.com/uk/software/preform/)
* The 3D printer "Form 3" from Formlabs
* The [standard resin from Formlabs](https://formlabs-media.formlabs.com/datasheets/Standard-DataSheet.pdf), with tensile strength at least 38 MPa.
