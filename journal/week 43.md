# The CO2 condenser (continued)
This week was dedicated to the design of a structure to convey the experiments at IMM. One of the requirements was usage of available materials and tools.

The past experiments have shown that the electrochemical cell made at DIFA/UNIBO is suitable to be used at target conditions: pressue 1M Pa, temperature -45 &deg;C. We now continue to design the CO2 condenser to be used in the vacuum chamber at IMM.

The rationaly and initial design of the CO2 condenser is described [earlier](</journal/week 40.md>). For convenience, it's shown below.
