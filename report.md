# Report on Working Project 4.1
Task 4.1:
* Description: Design and assembly of high-pressure cryogenic setup.
* Validation: Evaluation of ability of setup to perform under desired temperature and pressure ranges.

Deliverable 4.1:
* Fully operational high-pressure cryogenic setup available.

## Introduction
This part of the project aims to design a setup for electro- and photo-electrochemical CO2 reduction. The cell should create low temperature down to –60 °C, mimicking the polar climate, and be able to operate at high pressure up to 1 MPa. The setup will be later used to construct a photo-electrocemical cell (PEC) to facilitate firther research.

The both low temperature and high pressure form a condition necessary to liquify the gaseous CO2. The liquid CO2 will be tested as a solute, along with a range of low temperature solventes, for photoelectrolysis, using electrodes produced in other parts of this project. The generated chemical products will be firther analysed, e.g. with gas chromatography.

## State of the art

## Work Description
- High pressure is given, need for the low temp only.
- Two approaches for the low temp: climate camera, with termo-electric modules (TEC). Pros and cons.
- Energy flow (heat exchange calculation)
- Climate camera (working setup)
    - Existing cell, electrods (photo)
    - Liquid CO2 results (photo, graphs)
- TEC (in progress) (in progress) (in progress)
    - How low can we get with TEC? Tests: air, vacuum, water (photo, graphs)
    - Can we get lower? No data - make a model, validate it empirically 
    - Variants for precooling of PEC (schematics)
    - Wy we need a condenser
    - Design (sketch)
